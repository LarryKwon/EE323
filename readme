🧪 EE323 Network Programming Assignments
This repository contains solutions to four major network programming assignments from KAIST's EE323 Computer Networks course. The assignments progressively build an understanding of socket programming, application-layer protocols, network-layer routing, and transport-layer reliability.

🗂 Assignments Overview
📡 Assignment 1: TCP Echo Server and Client
Goal: Implement a simple server that accepts TCP connections and echoes client messages line by line.

✅ Each client runs in its own process (via fork()).

✅ Message is transmitted upon pressing Enter.

✅ Double Enter triggers client exit.

✅ Command-line interface using getopt() (-p, -h).

✅ Compatible with file redirection and piping (< input.txt, > output.txt).

📁 Files:

server.c

client.c

Makefile

📌 Run:

bash
복사
편집
# Server
$ ./server -p 12345

# Client
$ ./client -p 12345 -h 127.0.0.1
🌐 Assignment 2: HTTP Proxy Server
Goal: Build a multi-client HTTP/1.0 proxy server supporting basic caching and blacklisting.

✅ Accepts requests, forwards them to destination servers, returns responses.

✅ Parses HTTP requests (method, URL, host).

✅ Filters blacklisted domains and redirects to http://warning.or.kr.

✅ Can be tested with browser, telnet, or Python script.

✅ Properly handles malformed requests with HTTP 400.

📁 Files:

proxy.c

Makefile

📌 Run:

bash
복사
편집
$ ./proxy <PORT> < blacklist.txt
📌 Test (example):

bash
복사
편집
$ telnet localhost <PORT>
GET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.0
Host: example.com
🚦 Assignment 3: Software Router Implementation (via Mininet + POX)
Goal: Simulate a software router that performs routing, ARP handling, ICMP response, and packet forwarding in a Mininet-emulated network.

✅ Responds to ARP requests and maintains ARP cache.

✅ Responds to ICMP Echo Requests and Time Exceeded (Traceroute).

✅ Filters packets from blacklisted subnets (10.0.2.0/24).

✅ Drops packets with unresolved ARP after timeout, replies with ICMP Unreachable.

✅ Fully tested using Mininet and POX SDN controller.

📁 Files:

router/sr_router.c

router/sr_arpcache.c

router/Makefile

📌 Run (inside VM):

bash
복사
편집
$ ./run_pox.sh
$ ./run_mininet.sh
$ ./sr
📦 Assignment 4: Reliable Transport Layer (STCP)
Goal: Implement a simplified TCP-like transport protocol called STCP.

✅ Three-way handshake (SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK)

✅ Four-way connection teardown (FIN/ACK)

✅ In-order, reliable, full-duplex transmission

✅ Sliding window with slow start

✅ Logging transmission statistics (client_log.txt, server_log.txt)

✅ Compatible with mysock interface (provided stub)

📁 Files:

transport.c (ONLY file modified)

Compiles with provided Makefile

📌 Run:

bash
복사
편집
# Server
$ ./server

# Client
$ ./client <SERVER_IP>:<PORT> -f testfile.txt
📌 Output:

File rcvd is saved at the client side.

Logs are saved in the root directory.

🛠 Build Instructions
Each assignment contains a Makefile. Run:

bash
복사
편집
$ make
To clean:

bash
복사
편집
$ make clean
⚠ All code is tested and compiled on KAIST lab machines (eelab5, eelab6). Behavior may vary on other environments.
