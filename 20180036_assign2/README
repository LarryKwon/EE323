1. At first, I had implemented  500 error, but I removed it after the new announcement. 
if you want to show that error, you can do that by removing comments

2. I implemented the 404 error. when the return value of getaddrinfo(Host,Port,&host_hints,&hostinfo) is null, I close socket to clients and return EXIT_FAILURE. I had implemented this function before the announcement, but I don’t want to remove this function, so I keep it. 

3. when you execute the proxy, the proxy will print the hostname and it’s ip address of where you want to connect. As there is no restriction for proxy’s output, I added this one for check.
